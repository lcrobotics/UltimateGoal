/**
 * This 2020-2021 OpMode illustrates the basics of using the Vuforia localizer to determine
 * positioning and orientation of robot on the ULTIMATE GOAL FTC field.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * When images are located, Vuforia is able to determine the position and orientation of the
 * image relative to the camera.  This sample code then combines that information with a
 * knowledge of where the target images are on the field, to determine the location of the camera.
 *
 * From the Audience perspective, the Red Alliance station is on the right and the
 * Blue Alliance Station is on the left.

 * There are a total of five image targets for the ULTIMATE GOAL game.
 * Three of the targets are placed in the center of the Red Alliance, Audience (Front),
 * and Blue Alliance perimeter walls.
 * Two additional targets are placed on the perimeter wall, one in front of each Tower Goal.
 * Refer to the Field Setup manual for more specific location details
 *
 * A final calculation then uses the location of the camera on the robot to determine the
 * robot's location and orientation on the field.
 *
 * @see VuforiaLocalizer
 * @see VuforiaTrackableDefaultListener
 * see  ultimategoal/doc/tutorial/FTC_FieldCoordinateSystemDefinition.pdf
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: In order to use this OpMode, you need to obtain your own Vuforia license key as
 * is explained below.
